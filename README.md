# Solving-Rubik-s-Cube-Using-Graph-Thoery
Graph theory is an effective way of finding solution for a rubik's cube.Given the huge state space of 43 quintillion possible unique combinations, reaching the goal state becomes a challenge. Bidirectional search, Breadth first search, Depth First Search have been explored to understand the various possibilities of finding the solution.  \paragraph{} In order to solve the problem, we then developed an algorithm using a combination of Breadth First Search, Depth First Search and Hash map. BFS works very efficiently at lower level depth and hence proves extremely useful to find solutions present at lower depths. Depth First Search allows us to make use of multi core environment, thus allowing various nodes to be explored at the same time and finding the solution. DFS has a chance of going into infinite loop. In order to avoid it, we used a limited depth first search.The search ends by making use of a hash table. Hash table acts as a look up table which allows us to match the cost of the cube and find a match for the solve. The solution is provided by the path stored in the node as it travels down the search tree using different algorithms. We have successfully seen that each of the possible 43 quintillion nodes are being explored if the solution reaches the level 20.
